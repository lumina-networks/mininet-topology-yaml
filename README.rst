A CLI plugin for `topology-yaml <https://github.com/lumina-networks/topology-yaml>`_.

It makes creating Table and Clos (spine/leaf) topology files easier.

Most importantly it is able to spawn a mininet session with the hosts, switches, links and connect to the controllers
defined in the topology file.
